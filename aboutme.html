        <p>I'm a 24 year old student that lost my way when i was younger and stopped going to highschool because of the pressures of having to start working young. I was part of the Adult Basic Skill's program at LaGuardia Community College before i became an official college student here. I worked hard to get where i am today and i think because of the stuff i went through it made me want to pursue higher education. I think I'm a hard worker now because I learned to suffer, and the suffering is what woke me up and i realized what potential i had to be a great student. I had amazing professor's at laguardia when i was in the ABS program and also now in my college career.</p>
