          <li>Video Production 1</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of these courses that i took for my major have all given me useful experience Intro to New Media introduced me to being able to get a website up and running. Multimedia Web design we really focus on the importance of design and creativity needed to work with potential clients, so we focus on adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator. My Computer Art class was basically all about design as well and we primarily used Adobe illustrator to work on business cards and we even made a company logo.</p>

        <p>My E-Commerce class was a class that helped me understand the marketing side of buisness and for this class we had to develop ideas and pitches to market the idea. it was very similar to Shark Tank. My Introduction to Web-Development class is a great class because it goes way more in depth with the structure of a website and how to know how to read code to make it look presentable.This class helped me learn new things in a basic webpage and it absolutly made me feel more comfortable writing code in HTML & CSS. My last class I haven't mentioned yet is my Video Production class. This class made me love film and its an amazing class because we get to work hands on with professional equipment. This is one of my most relaxing favorite classes that im lucky to take.
